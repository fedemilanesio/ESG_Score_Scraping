# ESG_Score_Scraping

Very basic but useful code that helped me out to automate the recording of ESG risk score data related to companies listed on the Dow Jones Global Select ESG RESI index. Data were required for a part of the project I conducted during an internship experience this year (2024). Since yfinance library resulted inadeguate for this kind of task, I implemented some functionalities of Selenium to retrieve the companies' score. Big room of improvement from a stability point of view, but the code worked for the necessities.
