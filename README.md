# ESG_Score_Scraping

Very basic but useful code that helped me out to automate the recording of ESG risk score data related to companies listed on the Dow Jones Global Select ESG RESI index, needed for the explainability of the Hierachical Risk Parity outputs (Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado, 2016) for portfolio management. Data were required for a part of the project I conducted during a data science internship experience this year (2024) at Rulex Innovation Labs (Genova). Since "yfinance" library resulted inadeguate for this kind of task, I implemented some functionalities of Selenium to retrieve the companies' score. Big room of improvement from a stability point of view, but the code worked for the necessities.
